# C-Notes-
What is C...

C is a programming language developed at AT & T’s Bell
Laboratories of USA in 1972.

Constants, Variables and Keywords...

The alphabets, numbers and special symbols when properly
combined form constants, variables and keywords. Let us see what
are ‘constants’ and ‘variables’ in C. A constant is an entity that
doesn’t change whereas a variable is an entity that may change

Types of C Constants...

C constants can be divided into two major categories:

(a)Primary Constants:-
         
Integer Constant:-
An integer constant must have at least one digit.It must not have a decimal point.
It can be either positive or negative.No commas or blanks are allowed within an integer constant.the range of an Integer constant depends upon the
compiler.

Real Constant:-
A real constant must have at least one digit.It must have a decimal point.It could be either positive or negative.Default sign is positive.No commas or blanks are allowed within a real constant.

Character Constant:-
A character constant is a single alphabet, a single digit or a
single special symbol enclosed within single inverted
commas. Both the inverted commas should point to the left.
For example, ’A’ is a valid character constant whereas ‘A’ is
not.the maximum length of a character constant can be 1
character.

(b)Secondary Constants:-

Array
Pointer
Structure
Union
Enum, etc.

C Variables:-

Variable names are names given to
locations in memory. These locations can contain integer, real or
character constants.A variable name is any combination of 1 to 31 alphabets,
digits or underscores. Some compilers allow variable names
whose length could be up to 247 characters. Still, it would be
safer to stick to the rule of 31 characters. Do not create
unnecessarily long variable names as it adds to your typing
effort.
The first character in the variable name must be an alphabet or
underscore.
No commas or blanks are allowed within a variable name.
No special symbol other than an underscore (as in gross_sal)
can be used in a variable name.


C Keywords:-

Keywords are the words whose meaning has already been
explained to the C compiler.
The keywords cannot be used as variable names because if we do
so we are trying to assign a new meaning to the keyword, which is
not allowed by the computer.

%f for printing real values
%d for printing integer values
%c for printing character values

Compilation and Execution:-

Once you have written the program you need to type it and instruct
the machine to execute it. To type your C program you need
another program called Editor. Once the program has been typed it
needs to be converted to machine language (0s and 1s) before the
machine can execute it. To carry out this conversion we need
another program called Compiler. Compiler vendors provide an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which consists of an
Editor as well as the Compiler.

C Instructions:-

Type declaration instruction - To declare the type of variables used in a C program.
Arithmetic instruction - To perform arithmetic operations between constants and variables.
Control instruction - To control the sequence of execution of various statements in a C program.
