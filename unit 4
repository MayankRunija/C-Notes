The Case Control Structure:- 

Decisions Using switch
The control statement that allows us to make a decision from the number 

of choices is called a switch, or more correctly a switchcase- default, 

since these three keywords go together to make up the control 

statement. They most often appear as follows:

switch ( integer expression )

{

case constant 1 :

do this ;

case constant 2 :

do this ;

case constant 3 :

do this ;

default :

do this ;

}

The integer expression following the keyword switch is any C expression 

that will yield an integer value. It could be an integer constant like 

1, 2 or 3, or an expression that evaluates to an integer. The keyword 

case is followed by an integer or a character constant. Each constant 

in each case must be different from all the others. The “do this” lines 

in the above form of switch represent any valid C statement. 

example:- 

main( )

{

int i = 2 ;

switch ( i )

{

case 1 :
printf ( "I am in case 1 \n" ) ;
break ;

case 2 :
printf ( "I am in case 2 \n" ) ;
break ;

case 3 :
printf ( "I am in case 3 \n" ) ;
break ;

default :
printf ( "I am in default \n" ) ;

}

}

The output of this program would be:

I am in case 2


The goto Keyword:- In a difficult programming situation it seems so 

easy to use a goto to take the control where you want. However, almost 

always, there is a more elegant way of writing the same program using 

if, for,while and switch. These constructs are far more logical and 

easy to understand.

example:-

main( )

{

int i, j, k ;

for ( i = 1 ; i <= 3 ; i++ )

{

for ( j = 1 ; j <= 3 ; j++ )

{

for ( k = 1 ; k <= 3 ; k++ )

{

if ( i == 3 && j == 3 && k == 3 )

goto out ;

else

printf ( "%d %d %d\n", i, j, k ) ;

}

}

}

out :

printf ( "Out of the loop at last!" ) ;

}
